Reflection: What was most challenging/surprising in completing this week’s project?

I don't think anything was particularily challenging, but working with date-time fields was something I haven't done much of so just working with those was a little different compared to floats. 

Reflection: Is there anywhere you are still stuck or confused? Or Is there a particular part of the project where you want focused feedback from your reviewers?

I think it was ok this week, but if there are any points that could be improved I'd be happy to know!
